This is implementation of the classic Arkanoid game, written in Java as a project in
the Object-Oriented course I took at the 1st year in Bar Ilan University. 

The game has 3 levels which you can enjoy.

the makefile has 3 targets:

1. compile: compiles all packages in the src directory, using the resources in the directory with
the same name, and using the biuoop jar and the tools provided.

2. run: runs the game after compiling with the "compile" target.

3. jar: generates the portable jar, which can later be moved and executed from any
other computer that runs JVM.
